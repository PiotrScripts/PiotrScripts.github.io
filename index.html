            <h2>What is an Anti-Cheat</h2>
            <p>
                Anti-cheat software (ACS) attempts to prevent cheats from being used in a game. As there are different types of cheats: lag switching, aimbots, wall hacks, and scripting to name a few, there is various ACS to neutralize them.

                You've got server-side ACS which only runs when you load a game. While playing, the software will scan your PC's active processes, detecting anything out of the ordinary. This could be files you've downloaded to the system, whether they are running or not, or how your network is interacting with others. An example of this is Easy AntiCheat, which launches with every Epic Games game you download.
                
                Then there is kernel-side ACS that is granted access to a deeper level of your PC's system. Kernel-side ACS will have extremely high privileges, higher than even your device drivers and other apps you install onto your system. BattlEye represents a kernel-side ACS used in games like Destiny 2 and Ark: Survival Evolved.

                The ACS for a game is usually at the disclosure of the developer. You've probably encountered an ACS file being downloaded onto your PC when you've installed a game before and wondered why it's important.

            <h2>How to bypass an Anti-Cheat</h2>
            <p>
                Bypassing an Anti-Cheat is no easy task, since most high level Anti-Cheats having millions in funding and are actively worked on by experienced developers.
                However I will be going over a modern solution for our modern problem, 
                using AI for <a href="infogathering.html">info gathering</a> and external hardware for <a href="mousemanipulation.html">mouse manipulation</a>.
